      <p><h3>This is the page where I talk about my hobbies in-depth. First up, running.</h3>
        <br>
         I love to run and have been running 5Ks every other day since 2018.
        <br>
      In 2019 I ran the <a href="http://www.torontowaterfrontmarathon.com/">Toronto Waterfront Half Marathon</a>.
      You should click the link to find out more about the event.
      <br>
      What I liked most about the Toronto Waterfront Marathon was
      that it basically gave the runner a tour of the city. We ran <em>everywhere.</em>
      <br>
    On the day I was very excited, although when I had arrived at the 9KM mark, I remember thinking that perhaps this was
  a mistake, but I kept on truckin' and I finished the 21KMs in just under 3 hours.
